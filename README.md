Serene Escapes will give you proper guidance from the perspective of IIIT Bhagalpur's student about some lowkey as well as popular trip destinations near you. We have informations about places that are so obscure that even government tourism websites doesn't mention them. We here at ByteBuilders are trying to give those marvels of architecture and history a chance to be recognised.

As we are very novice in the art of web development, our website may or may not impress you but beleive me when I say if you choose to visit anyy of these recommendations by our team you will surely look past our technical disparities and may appreciate our efforts.
So explore our website and read the briefs about these abode of intellect, art and devotion and if possible choose one as your next adventure.
